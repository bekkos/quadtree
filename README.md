# quadtree
This is a js implementation of the quadtree datastructure and a demo where it is used for efficient collision detection in 2D space.

## Quadtree Collision Demo
The quadtree datastructure dynamically divides the grid into n levels of depth depending on initialization specs and number of nodes in the occupied area. This allows for efficient storage and access to nodes on a grid. The quadtree works well for 2D space, where as octrees are used for 3D.
